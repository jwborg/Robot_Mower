Mower issue list

1, PCB v1.0 - Mtr A PWM is connected to D4, which is nor PWM capable. Currently the following 
   is done to avoid PCN board changes:

	a. Mtr A DIR (D5) cable is now connected to D4
	b. Mtr A PWM (D4) cable is now connected to D5 (PWM capable).
	c. motor_0_1_slave_i2c_pid_softstart has been configured to use Mtr A PWM on D5 and Mtr B PWM on D6

	PCB board update.

2. ESD flipflop state should have a indicator LED when operated.

	PCB board update

3. ESD should be normally on, currently normally off.

4. Arduino Nano USB port cannot be connected due to position of the Motor connectors. Otherwise require D2 and D3 pins for RX and TX.

5. I2C pull-up resistors nor required on 3.3 and 5V side, due to logic converter.

6. Require Ground pin for testing.

7. Need I2C for compass on 5V

8. Use a 8 port AND more ready available

9. Need more testing pins (5V, 3V, GND, I2C Data, clock)

10. Mowing motor pins, signal is 3.3 V, but power to board is 5V. Either convert to 5V. Integrate relays on board?

11. Need a ESD that stops (brakes) the mowing motor and stops driving but does not power down the Raspberry and Arduino. 

12. The mowing motor requires an additional relay to brake the motor.

13. Set up test pins from I2C, ground, 5V etc.

14. Need additional interrupts for manual control (Xbox controller) and ESD.
